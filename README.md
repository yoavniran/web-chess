# Web Chess

This is a fun side project born of my relatively new passion for Chess
Here I will try to implement as many features (seen on sites like chess.com & lichess.org)
for the UI side of playing online chess.

> Backend and Engine are out of scope for now...

An implementation of a playable chess board using web technologies: 

- React
- Recoil JS
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion
